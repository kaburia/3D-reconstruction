# 3D-reconstruction

This project demonstrates a pipeline for 3D reconstruction using a series of images. The pipeline is integrated into a Flask application that allows users to upload the images and obtain a 3D reconstruction in the form of an OBJ file.

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. Image Acquisition
Capture a series of images from different viewpoints. Ensure sufficient coverage and overlap between the images to facilitate accurate reconstruction.

### 2. Feature Extraction
Detect and extract distinctive features from the images. Use feature extraction algorithms like SIFT, SURF, or ORB to identify key points or regions.

### 3. Feature Matching
Match corresponding features across the images to establish correspondences. This step helps determine the camera poses and the 3D structure of the object.

### 4. Camera Calibration
Perform camera calibration using a calibration pattern or known geometry to estimate the camera parameters. This step is crucial for accurate reconstruction. OpenCV provides functions for camera calibration.

### 5. Structure from Motion (SfM)
Apply structure from motion techniques to estimate camera poses and the 3D structure of the object based on the feature correspondences. Libraries like OpenCV or VisualSFM can assist with SfM.

### 6. Dense Reconstruction
Utilize the estimated camera poses and the feature correspondences to perform dense reconstruction, estimating the depth or 3D position for each pixel in the images. Algorithms like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) or depth estimation from stereo matching can be used for this step.

### 7. Mesh Reconstruction
Generate a mesh representation of the 3D object from the dense reconstruction results. This step involves surface reconstruction algorithms like Poisson reconstruction or marching cubes.
